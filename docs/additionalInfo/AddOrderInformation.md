# Adding Order Information

The *Order Information* section has only one required field: the total amount of the order (including all taxes and shipping). Other fields in the section are optional and can be used at your discretion.

You must fill out all required fields. To enter Order Information, follow the steps below.

### *Order Number (optional)*

For regular credit card transactions, this field is optional. If you wish to assign an order number to this order, enter one in the text box provided.

Each order number must be unique, so if you are going to use this field on a regular basis, you should adopt an order number generation procedure. If you choose not to assign an order number, the First Data system will automatically generate one for you.


### *Purchase Order Number (optional)*

If there is a purchase order number associated with this order, enter it here. Because you may have several transactions against the same purchase order, you may use the same purchase order number for several transactions, if needed. For regular credit card transactions, this field is optional.

 

### *Shipping Amount (optional)*

If there are shipping charges associated with this order and if you wish to track your shipping charges, enter a real or integer number equalling the charge for shipping this order.


### *VAT (if applicable)*

There may be cases where you are doing international business where you need to charge a Value Added Tax (VAT), either in addition to or in lieu of the regular sales tax. If the Value Added Tax applies to your order and if you need to charge the customer the VAT now, enter the amount of the VAT in the VAT field. In some cases, you may not need to charge the VAT; it will be taken care of when the goods are imported.


### *Total Amount (required)*

As you enter Subtotal, Tax and VAT, the Virtual Terminal will automatically calculate the total amount for you. If you need to, you can replace this value with any real or integer number representing the total amount of the transaction. The total amount should include tax, VAT (if applicable), and shipping charges, and should reflect the sum of all charges for this transaction. The total amount should always equal the sum of the product subtotal, tax, shipping, and VAT.

This is a required field for ALL transactions.


### *Currency (required)*

If you want to use another currency for this transaction then the displayed default currency, you can change it using the drop-down box.
