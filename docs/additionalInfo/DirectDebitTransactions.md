# Enter payment data for Direct Debit transactions

The Payment Details section for Direct Debit transactions shows fields for the customer's IBAN (International Bank Account Number), the Account Holder, <br/> an optional field for the Mandate Reference and a drop-down menu for the Mandate type.

If you do not enter a Mandate Reference, a mandate reference starting with the prefix 'IPG', a time stamp and a random value will automatically be assigned.

If you set the Mandate type to Recurring, an additional mandatory field appears where the Mandate Date needs to be entered.

 

If you are using the Local Payments solution for SEPA Direct Debit you will be provided with a couple of additional fields which are mandatory to support retrieving the relevant mandate:

- Mandate Date - To be populated with the initial mandate signature date
- Mandate URL - To be populated with the valid URL of the SEPA mandate to enable the Risk and Compliance department to access the details.
