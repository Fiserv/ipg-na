# Payment Method Values


If your customers select the payment method within your webstore and you post a HTML form to initiate the payment, your request needs to contain a value for the parameter paymentMethod.

If you do not submit this parameter, a hosted form will be displayed to your customer to make the selection based on the payment methods that have been activated for your Store ID.

*Only supported in a collecting model through the Fiserv's [Local Payments](?path=docs/additionalInfo/LocalPayments.md) solution.
