# Pre-validation of Card Type

If the functionality is activated for your store and a card number is entered, the field Debit / Credit will automatically populate with whether the card number belongs to a credit or debit card based on a BIN file lookup in the background.

In case of dual functionality cards the field will be enabled to let merchants choose the card function for the transaction (drop-down).

The card type is also shown on the Confirmation Page, the Order Details and the Receipt.
