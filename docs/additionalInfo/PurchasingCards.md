Purchasing Cards offer businesses the ability to allow their employees to purchase items with a credit card while providing additional information on sales tax, customer code etc. Providing specific details on the payment being made with a Purchasing card can enable qualification of favourable addendum interchange rates.

There are three levels of details required:

	- Level I — The first level is the standard transaction data; no enhanced data is required at this level.
	- Level II — The second level requires that data such as tax amount and customer code be supplied in addition to the standard transaction date.  (Visa only have a level II option)
	- Level III — The third level allows a merchant to pass a detailed accounting of goods and services purchased to the buyer. All the data for Level I and Level II must also be passed to participate in Level III. (Visa and Mastercard).
