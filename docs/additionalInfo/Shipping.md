# Generate a Payment URL

The Payment URL functionality allows you to provide a link (URL) to your customers e.g. in an email invoice, WhatsApp message, SMS, QR code, etc. which then takes the customer to a webpage, hosted by Fiserv, where they can securely make the payment with their preferred payment method, whenever convenient for them.

This solution is especially useful in scenarios where goods get paid after delivery, where no goods get shipped at all (e.g. final payment for trips that have been booked months ago) or for the payment of monthly bills.

You can also implement this functionality for unsuccessful purchases where the original payment transaction has been declined so that you can proactively give your customers a second chance to make their purchase.

The Payment URL solution offers you the following:

	- The capability to generate a link (a payment URL) for a specific amount through an Application Programming Interface (API) call or manually through a Virtual Terminal on the web.
	- A hosted payment page where your customer can select the preferred payment method (based on the payment methods that are activated for your account/store) and make the payment.
	- A hosted result page that tells your customer if the payment was successful or not, including a ‘Retry’ button that allows a customer to choose a different payment method in case the transaction was not successful.

As a default, the Payment Links stay valid for 182 days.
