# Review the Results

The result screen will contain all the information you entered, plus an extra section at the top called *Transaction Information*.

For retail merchants who need a receipt for the customer to sign, there is a print receipt function. Simply click on the *Show Receipt button* at the bottom of the *Transaction Result page*. A new browser window will open with a transaction receipt. Click on the Print Receipt button at the bottom of the Receipt page to print the receipt. Once you have printed all the receipts you need, close the receipt window by clicking on the Close button at the bottom or on the X in the top right hand corner of the Receipt window.

The *Transaction Information* section is where you will see whether the transaction was approved or declined. If the transaction was approved, the *Transaction Status* line will say Approved. The Date and Time of transaction, a *Transaction reference number*, an *Approval Code*, and a *Reference number* will follow.
