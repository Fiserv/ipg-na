# Zero Dollar Authorization

A Zero Dollar Authorization, also sometimes referred to as a Verification transaction, provides merchants with an effective way of validating account number and other elements such as CVV and AVS (Address Verification Service) without actually charging the card.  The chart below represents the card brand support of Zero Dollar Authorizations.  If not supported, the Gateway will return responses received from the Issuers and Fiserv Processing platforms.
